# Gilded Rose

[The "Gilded Rose"](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) is a refactoring exercise. This repo is a slightly custom version of that Kata where the explicit aim is to follow a functional approach when rewriting the code.

1. Fork this repo: click Fork in the top-right of the page - this will create a copy of this repo in **your own GitHub account**

2. Clone (download) the repo
    * Go to your newly-created fork of the repo (on GitHub).
    * Click `Clone or download` (the green button on the right).
    * Make sure the page says `Clone with SSH` (rather than `Clone with HTTPS`).
    * Open your git client (e.g. GitKraken) and use this link to clone the repo.  
    Your trainer will be able to help you with this.

3. "Cloning the repo" will create a folder on your computer with the files from this repo.  
Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.

4. Run this command to build your code: `dotnet build`

5. Run this command to run the tests: `dotnet test`

# Requirements

See the [Gilded Rose Requirements Specification](./gilded_rose_requirements.md) for a description of what the code is for.
